I call this Okroshka a summer soup because it’s served cold. It’s very refreshing to have chilled soup on a hot summer day. I can eat three bowls of this on a hungry stomach. (A mom who chases after a 1-year-old gets hungry ok?!) It’s relatively guilt free; no butter or oils required. Easy, cheap and healthy; that’s my kinda meal.

Ingredients for Okroshka Soup:

8 cups cold water
1/3 cup sour cream
3 1/2 Tbsp Vinegar divided
2 1/2 tsp Salt
3 Tbsp chopped dill (fresh or frozen)
1/2 cup green onion, finely chopped
1/2 ham diced
3-4 medium cooked potatoes, peeled and diced
3 hard-boiled eggs, diced
3-4 cucumbers, diced
